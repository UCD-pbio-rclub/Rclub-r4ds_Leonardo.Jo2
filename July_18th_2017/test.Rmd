## 14.3 Matching patterns with regular expressions

x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(x, "an")

str_view(x, ".a.")
dot <- "\\."
dot
writeLines(dot)

str_view(c("abc", "a.c", "bef"), "a\\.c")

x <- "a\\b"
writeLines(x)
str_view(x, "\\\\")


## 14.3.1.1 Exercises
## Explain why each of these strings don’t match a \: "\", "\\", "\\\"
a <- c("\\", "\\\\\\", "\\\\")
str_view(a,"\\\\")
a
writeLines(a)


## 14.3.2 Anchors

x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(x, "[na]{4}")

x <- c("apple pie", "apple", "apple cake")
str_view(x, "apple")

str_view(x, "^apple$")

## Exercise 14.3.2.1
## How would you match the literal string "$^$"?
a <- "$^$"
b <- c("$^$", "$^$.", "$^$..")
str_view(b, "\\$\\^\\$")
writeLines(a)

## Given the corpus of common words in stringr::words, create regular expressions that find all words that:
a <- stringr::words
##Start with “y”.
str_view(a, "^y", match = T)
##End with “x”
str_view(a, "x$", match = T)
str_view(a, "^y.+y$", match = T)
##Are exactly three letters long. (Don’t cheat by using str_length()!)
str_view(a, "^.{3}$", match = T)
##Have seven letters or more.
str_view(a, "^.{7}+", match = T)
##Since this list is long, you might want to use the match argument to str_view() to show only the matching or non-matching words.


## 14.3.3 Character classes and alternatives
str_view(c("grey", "gray"), "gr(e|a)y") ## | or

##  14.3.3.1 Exercises
## Create regular expressions to find all words that:
## Start with a vowel.
str_view(a, "^[aeiou]", match = T)
## That only contain consonants. (Hint: thinking about matching “not”-vowels.)
str_view(a, "^[^aeiou]+$", match = T)
## End with ed, but not with eed.
str_view(a, "ed+$", match = T)
str_view(a, "[^e]ed+$", match = T)
## End with ing or ise
str_view(a, "(ing$|ise$)", match = T)

## Empirically verify the rule “i before e except after c”.
a <- stringr::words
a
str_view(a, "[c][i]e", match = T)

## Is “q” always followed by a “u”?

str_view(a, "[q]+", match = T)
str_view(a, "[q][^u]+", match = T)

## Write a regular expression that matches a word if it’s probably written in British English, not American English.

## Create a regular expression that will match telephone numbers as commonly written in your country.       
a <- c("000-000-0000","000-0000-0000")
str_view(a, "[\\d]{3}-[\\d]{3}-[\\d]{4}")


## 14.3.4 Repetition

x <- "1888 is the longest year in Roman numerals: MDCCCLXXXVIII"
str_view(x, "CC?")
str_view(x, "CC+")
str_view(x, "CC*")
str_view(x, 'C[LX]+')
str_view(x, "C{2,3}")

str_view(x, 'C{2,3}?')

## 14.3.4.1 Exercises

## 1. Describe the equivalents of ?, +, * in {m,n} form.
str_view(x, "1?")
str_view(x, "1{0,1}")
str_view(x, "X+")
str_view(x, "X{1,10000}")
str_view(x, "1*")
str_view(x, "1{0,10000}")

## 2. Describe in words what these regular expressions match: (read carefully to see if I’m using a regular expression or a string that defines a regular expression.)

## ^.*$ ANY string that start with character and finishes as a character
str_view(x, "^.*$")

##  "\\{.+\\}"
a <- "{aa}bb"
str_view(a, "\\{.+\\}") ## \\ to specifiy that {} are characters

##\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}
b <- "1234-22-33"
str_view(b, "\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}")

## "\\\\{4}"
c <- "\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"
str_view(c, "\\\\{4}")

## 3. Create regular expressions to find all words that:
a <- stringr::words

##Start with three consonants.
a %>%
  str_view("^[^aeiou]{3}", match = T)

##Have three or more vowels in a row.
a %>%
  str_view("[aeiou]{3}", match = T)

##Have two or more vowel-consonant pairs in a row.
a %>%
  str_view("([aeiou][^aeiou]){2,100}", match = T)

## 14.3.5 Grouping and backreferences

str_view(fruit, "(..)\\1", match = TRUE)


## 14.3.5.1 Exercises

## 1. Describe, in words, what these expressions will match:

##(.)\1\1 
a <- c("aaaaddddcccc","bb")
str_view(a, "(.)\\1\\1\\1")

## "(.)(.)\\2\\1"
str_view(a, "(.)(.)\\2\\1")
## (..)\1
## "(.).\\1.\\1"
## "(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1"

## Didn't really get this part

## Construct regular expressions to match words that:
a <- stringr::words
## Start and end with the same character.
str_view(a, "^(.).+(.)\\1$", match = T)
## Contain a repeated pair of letters (e.g. “church” contains “ch” repeated twice.)
str_view(a, "(..)", match = T)

## 14.4 Tools

x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_detect(x, "e")
#> [1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE

# How many common words start with t?
##LOGIC ARGUMENTS in a numeric context, FALSE = 0 and TRUE = 0
sum(str_detect(words, "^t"))

# What proportion of common words end with a vowel?
mean(str_detect(words, "[aeiou]$"))
#> [1] 0.277

# Find all words containing at least one vowel, and negate
no_vowels_1 <- !str_detect(words, "[aeiou]")
# Find all words consisting only of consonants (non-vowels)
no_vowels_2 <- str_detect(words, "^[^aeiou]+$")
identical(no_vowels_1, no_vowels_2)

words[str_detect(words, "x$")]
#> [1] "box" "sex" "six" "tax"
str_subset(words, "x$")
#> [1] "box" "sex" "six" "tax"

df <- tibble(
  word = words, 
  i = seq_along(word)
)


df %>% 
  filter(str_detect(words, "x$")) ##filter find rows having specific values or string patterns

x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_count(x, "a")
#> [1] 1 3 1

# On average, how many vowels per word?
mean(str_count(words, "[aeiou]"))
#> [1] 1.99

df %>% 
  mutate(
    vowels = str_count(word, "[aeiou]"),
    consonants = str_count(word, "[^aeiou]")
  )

str_count("abababa", "aba")
#> [1] 2
str_view_all("abababa", "aba")

## 14.4.2 Exercises

## 1. For each of the following challenges, try solving it by using both a single regular expression, and a combination of multiple str_detect() calls.

## Find all words that start or end with x.
df %>% filter(str_detect(words, "x$")) # Four Words
df %>% filter(str_detect(words, "^x")) # Zero Words
df %>% filter(str_detect(words, "^(x)|(x)$")) 

## Find all words that start with a vowel and end with a consonant.
df %>% filter(str_detect(words, "^[aeiou].*[^aeiou]$"))

## Are there any words that contain at least one of each different vowel?
a <- df %>% filter(str_detect(words, "[a]+"))
e <- df %>% filter(str_detect(words, "[e]+"))
i <- df %>% filter(str_detect(words, "[i]+"))
o <- df %>% filter(str_detect(words, "[o]+"))
u <- df %>% filter(str_detect(words, "[u]+"))

merge(a,e, by ="word") %>%
  merge(i, by ="word") %>%
  merge(o, by ="word") %>%
  merge(u, by ="word")

## What word has the highest number of vowels? What word has the highest proportion of vowels? (Hint: what is the denominator?)
df2 <- df %>% 
  mutate(
    vowels = str_count(word, "[aeiou]"),
    letters = str_count(word, "[\\w]"),
    vowels.proportion = vowels/letters)

df2 %>%
  filter(vowels == max(vowels))

df2 %>%
  filter(vowels.proportion == max(vowels.proportion))


## 14.4.3 Extract matches
length(sentences)
head(sentences)

## Identifying every sentence that contains a collor
colours <- c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple")
colour_match <- str_c(colours, collapse = "|")
colour_match
has_colour <- str_subset(sentences, colour_match)
head(has_colour)
matches <- str_extract(has_colour, colour_match)
head(matches)

more <- sentences[str_count(sentences, colour_match) > 1]
str_count(sentences, colour_match)
str_view_all(more, colour_match)
str_view(more, colour_match) ## Differences?
str_extract(more, colour_match)
str_extract_all(more, colour_match)
str_extract_all(more, colour_match, simplify = T)

x <- c("a", "a b", "a b c", "d")
str_extract_all(x, "[a-z]", simplify = TRUE)

## 14.4.3.1 Exercises

## 1. In the previous example, you might have noticed that the regular expression matched “flickered”, which is not a colour. Modify the regex to fix the problem.
## adding spaces before each color
colours <- c(" red", " orange", " yellow", " green", " blue", " purple")
colour_match <- str_c(colours, collapse = "|")
more <- sentences[str_count(sentences, colour_match) > 1]
more

##From the Harvard sentences data, extract:
  
##The first word from each sentence.
first.word <- sentences %>%
  str_extract("^[\\w]+")
first.word
##All words ending in ing.

ing <- sentences[str_count(sentences, "[\\w]+ing") >= 1]
ing %>%
  str_extract_all("[\\w]+ing", simplify = T)

sentences %>%
  str_subset("[\\w]+ing") %>%
  str_extract_all("[\\w]+ing", simplify = T)

##All plurals.
plural <- sentences[str_count(sentences, "[\\w]+s[ ]|[\\w]+s[\\.]") >= 1]
plural %>%
  str_extract_all("[\\w]+s[ ]|[\\w]+s[\\.]", simplify = T)

sentences %>%
  str_subset("[\\w]+es[ ]|[\\w]+es[\\.]") %>%
  str_extract_all("[\\w]+es[ ]|[\\w]+es[\\.]", simplify = T)

## 14.4.4 Grouped matches
noun <- "(a|the) ([^ ]+)" ## what is ([^ ]+) 

has_noun <- sentences %>%
  str_subset(noun) %>%
  head(10)
has_noun
has_noun %>% 
  str_extract(noun)

has_noun %>% str_match(noun) 

tibble(sentence = sentences) %>% 
  tidyr::extract(
    sentence, c("article", "noun"), "(a|the) ([^ ]+)", 
    remove = FALSE
  )


## 14.4.4.1 Exercises

## 1. Find all words that come after a “number” like “one”, “two”, “three” etc. Pull out both the number and the word.
number <- "(one|two|three|four|five|six|seven|eight|nine) ([^ ]+)" ## what is ([^ ]+) 

has_number <- sentences %>%
  str_subset(number)
has_number
has_number %>% 
  str_extract(number)

has_number %>% str_match(number) 

## 2. Find all contractions. Separate out the pieces before and after the apostrophe.
contractions <- "([^ ]+)(\\')([^ ]+)"
has_contractions <- sentences %>%
  str_subset(contractions)
has_contractions
has_contractions %>% str_match(contractions) 

## 14.4.5 Replacing matches
x <- c("apple", "pear", "banana")
str_replace(x, "[aeiou]", "-") ## Only changes one letter
str_replace_all(x, "[aeiou]", "-") ## Changes all the letters


x <- c("1 house", "2 cars", "3 people")
str_replace_all(x, c("1" = "one", "2" = "two", "3" = "three"))


sentences %>% 
  str_replace("([^ ]+) ([^ ]+) ([^ ]+)", "\\1 \\3 \\2") %>% 
  head(5)


## 14.4.5.1 Exercises

## Replace all forward slashes in a string with backslashes.
a <- c("a/b","a/b/c", "a/b/c/d")
a %>% 
  str_replace_all("/","\\\\") %>%
  writeLines()

## Implement a simple version of str_to_lower() using replace_all().

first.letter <- sentences %>%
  str_extract("^[\\w]")
lower.letter <- tolower(first.letter)
sentences %>% 
  str_replace_all("^[\\w]", lower.letter) %>% 
  head(5)

## Switch the first and last letters in words. Which of those strings are still words?

words %>% 
  str_replace_all("^[\\w]", "[\\w]$") %>% 
  head(5) ## Don't Work!

words %>% 
  str_replace_all("(^[\\w]) ([\\w]$) ", "\\2 \\1") %>% 
  head(5) ## Don't Work!

last.letter <- words %>% 
  str_extract("[\\w]$")
last.letter

first.letter <- words %>%
  str_extract("^[\\w]")
first.letter

words %>% 
  str_replace_all("(^[\\w])", last.letter) %>%
  str_replace_all("([\\w]$)", first.letter)

```
