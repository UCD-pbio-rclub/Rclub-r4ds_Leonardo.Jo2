## 10.5 Exercises

### 1. How can you tell if an object is a tibble?

mtcars
class(mtcars)[1]
class(as_tibble(mtcars))[1]

### 2. Compare and contrast the following operations on a data.frame and equivalent tibble. What is different? Why might the default data frame behaviours cause you frustration?

df <- data.frame(abc = 1, xyz = "a")
df
df$xyz
df$xy
df[, "xyz"]
df[, c("abc", "xyz")]
#data.frame treats columns like factors

df <- tibble(abc = 1, xyz ="a")
df
df$xyz
df[, "xyz"]
#tibble don't treat columns like factors

var <- "mpg"
df <- tibble('abc' = c(1,2), 'xyz' = c("mpg","xxx"))
df
df %>% as_tibble() %>%
  filter(xyz, xyz == var)

subset(df, xyz == var)

annoying <- tibble(
  `1` = 1:10,
  `2` = `1` * 2 + rnorm(length(`1`))
)

## Practice referring to non-syntactic names in the following data frame by:
## Extracting the variable called 1.

annoying %>% filter(`1`, `1` == 1)

## Plotting a scatterplot of 1 vs 2.

ggplot(annoying) +
  geom_point(aes(`1`,`2`))

## Creating a new column called 3 which is 2 divided by 1.

annoying <- annoying %>% 
  mutate(`3`= `2`/`1`)

## Renaming the columns to one, two and three.

annoying %>%
  rename(`1` = `one`,`2`= `two`,`3`= `three`)

names(annoying) <- c("one", "two", "three")

annoying


## 5. What does tibble::enframe() do? When might you use it?
  
## Creates a tibble from atomic vectors of two clomuns 
??enframe
tibble::enframe(annoying, c("name","value","mean"))

enframe(1:3)
enframe(c(a = 5, b = 7))
enframe(annoying)
enframe(c(a = 1+1,b = 2+2))

## What option controls how many additional column names are printed at the footer of a tibble?

annoying
